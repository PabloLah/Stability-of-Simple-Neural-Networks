# **Stability of Simple Neural Network Architectures**

This repository contains the code and analysis from my bachelor's thesis, *Stability of Simple Neural Network Architectures*. The project investigates the performance and stability of basic neural network architectures, analyzing how different design choices affect their robustness and learning dynamics.

## **Overview**
Neural networks have become a fundamental tool in modern machine learning, but their stability—particularly in simple architectures—is not always well understood. In this study, I explore the behavior of small neural networks by:
- Implementing and training simple feedforward networks in Python.
- Examining how different architectures and activation functions impact learning.
- Using mathematical constraints and contour plots to visualize network stability.
- Analyzing how the learning rate influences the final weight configurations.

The goal is to gain insights into how small neural networks generalize and how their training dynamics lead to different optima.

## **Main Topics Covered**
- **Programming Neural Networks**: Basic implementations in Python using TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Interpolation with Simple Architectures**: Training neural networks to approximate functions with noise.
- **Stability Analysis**: Using mathematical constraints and contour plots to assess how robust learned weight configurations are.
- **Effect of Learning Rate**: Investigating how varying learning rates influence the convergence behavior of neural networks.

## **Code Structure**
- Jupyter notebooks with experimental results and visualizations.
- `report/`: Includes the full thesis as a PDF for reference.

## **How to Use This Repository**
This repository is meant as a reference for understanding stability in simple neural networks. The code is not guaranteed to be a plug-and-play framework but rather a collection of experiments that accompany my thesis. If you're interested in running the experiments, you may need to adapt the code to your setup.

## **Thesis Report**
The full report, detailing the theoretical background and experimental results, can be found in the `report/` directory.
